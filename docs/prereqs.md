# 1. AWS IoT Secure Tunneling Demo Prerequisites

Before you can start, you have to make sure your AWS Clpoud 9 environment is up and running and current.  Navigate to the Cloud9 console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9

Once you navigate to the Cloud9 console, click on the create environment button:

**Make sure you choose Ubuntu** as the platform. The reason for that is that this demo provides a copy of the distributables of local-proxy previously built for Ubuntu. Leave all the rest as the default configuration, we donâ€™t need a heavy server for this demo:

Once you confirm creation, after a couple of minutes, your environment should look like the following image:

(Optional) If you prefer a dark theme, chose the theme in the top menu: View > Themes > Cloud9 > Cloud 9 Night.
